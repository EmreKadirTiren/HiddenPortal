H-h-how do they know what I see in my dreams… He was shocked. He walked to the kitchen table and then saw the date on the clock; it was Saturday. He had gone to sleep when it was still Thursday. He opened the note and read:

Hello Qiqi,

Sorry we gave you some drugs; if you hadn’t noticed yet, it has been 3 days since you were last conscious. In that time, we took your whole house apart to find information on whether you are a spy or a traitor and to determine if you can be trusted. Good news, there is no surveillance equipment in your house, and you are trustworthy :). Unfortunately, we did have to take your house apart; we kept all the old stuff and books, but we replaced the rest. Here’s $2,000. We accept your terms, but before you tell anyone outside, think carefully. It could cause panic. You’ve passed our first qualification round. Now, to find us, you just need to... oh wait, it’s a test. We expect you in 2 hours.

BURN THIS LETTER AFTER YOU READ IT

- The Earthgate

The Earthgate... he had never heard of that before. He thought for a moment, and the puzzle wasn’t too hard. The pentagram stood for Venus. And the earthgate… of courset the gateway from Earth to the universe is an observatory: a building with a large telescope. A 'gate' is a portal or entrance to the universe and the planets, or… Venus. He went to his computer, which looked brand new; he had spent many hours there, checking research papers and, of course, gaming. He searched for:
Observatory + Venus + Netherlands

In Dordrecht, they were holding an event tonight to celebrate the completion of Venus’s cycle. He went to his wardrobe where a brand-new, very expensive tuxedo from Calvin Klein was hanging. He put it on and headed to the ball. But his journey would't end there.
