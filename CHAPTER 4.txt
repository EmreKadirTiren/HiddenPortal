Qiqi burned the note. The only thing left was the pentagram, which he put in his pocket in case he needed it later. When Qiqi went outside, he walked to his car. He entered the address into his navigation system and started driving. As he drove to Dordrecht, he took a moment to process everything that had happened today. There’s an organization called Earthgate. And we don’t even know if that’s their real name. They want to hire me, a not-so-special history teacher, to do who knows what. And before they even explained anything, they kidnapped me and broke into my house. And yet, here I am, following a trail to get a chance to be hired. Why? He didn’t know why or how, but something told him he had to do this.

Dordrecht wasn’t that far from Leiden, but it still took an hour to drive there. When he finally arrived, he realized he was two hours early. He parked his car at the Biesbosch. The Biesbosch was a large park where beavers lived, but people also came for nature because it was a big forest by the water. It was always nice to walk there, especially in the morning; you might even see some beavers. After a long walk through the Biesbosch, he returned to the observatory, where the ball was slowly beginning. He walked inside, where a woman with a list stood. Qiqi approached her. Before he could say anything, the woman said, "Ah, hello sir, they already said you would come. You’re on the VIP list. Go ahead to our VIP room and enjoy yourself." Now he at least knew he was in the right place. He walked to the VIP room, sat down, and was offered some champagne and a snack. He waited there until two men in black suits started walking toward him.
