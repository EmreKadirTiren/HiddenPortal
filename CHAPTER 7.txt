Just as the scientist in the white coat finished, a commander stood up. "Hello, I am your commander, Commander Olie. We have three teams, each with its own leader and objective. Remember your NDAs and that you are not allowed to share anything."

"Team 1: Your task is to find the secret ancient weapon that we will now call KO. Your leader is Qiqi. Along with him are Marike, Jelte, and Naud. You have access to our most powerful supercomputer ever. Because you have the most important task, this is only available to you." The commander handed him a dossier. The dossier was labeled 'Top secret,' and at the top, it read 'Project: KO.' As the commander listed the other teams, Qiqi began reading the dossier. The dossier contained a brief summary of the project:

"The KO is a device that has been used throughout the centuries to keep the world population low by releasing a new virus every hundred years. We also know that it was used as a weapon to wipe out as many Native Americans as possible. The last time it was used was during the Spanish flu, about a hundred years ago. Eventually, it was first discovered somewhere during World War II by the Dutch..."

Then suddenly, the commander said, "Each of you has your own rooms. Follow this soldier if you're in team 2, this one for team 3, and team 1 can stay seated for now. The rest may leave." As the commander said this, Qiqi was reminded of his high school days when the teacher would announce who could leave and who had to stay. Once everyone except the commander and team 1 had left the room, the commander began again: "Your task is the most crucial. Your team consists of a history expert, a computer tech, a doctor, and a soldier. Remember that your task is the most important. If he gets his hands on that machine, the world could turn into a post-apocalyptic wasteland. All governments will collapse, and those who don't die will fight and loot until no one is left."
