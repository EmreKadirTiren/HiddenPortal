A young man, around 20 years old, wearing a lab coat, stood up and started a beautifully made PowerPoint presentation. He began with: "A few weeks ago, one of our employees resigned. For some reason, he managed to bypass all our security and stole one of our deadliest viruses, along with a computer and the codes to launch a nuclear weapon. He believes that there are too many people living on Earth and that the richest are the ones who benefit the most. So, he plans to commit mass murder.

In addition to the virus and the nuclear weapon, he is searching for an ancient, powerful weapon that was responsible for creating and spreading viruses like the Spanish flu and the Black Death. This weapon has been used by multiple countries throughout history and was subsequently lost. This was fortunate, but now this rogue ex-employee is looking for it. That is why we have assembled a team to find it. We will introduce you to each other shortly. Your task is to investigate and find these weapons. There are three teams, and each team must find a weapon. I wish you all good luck, and remember that if you fail, the end of the world could be near."
