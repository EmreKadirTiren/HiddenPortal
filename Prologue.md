# Prologue
Kai, a young soldier in his twenties, ran through the base. He was the last surviving military member, fleeing through the long concrete corridors of the bunker. He looked left and right but couldn't find the portal room. While searching for the room, he heard footsteps behind him. Would he be the next one, he wondered. Eventually, he reached a dead end. "Why? What have we done to you?! You could have shared this with the rest of the world, but instead, you use it as you always do. You support dictatorships and overthrow governments you don't like, just to protect your economic interests." Then the soldier saw a hatch. He opened it and crawled through. He turned right into the ventilation shaft and then heard gunshots. The bullets hit the walls of the shaft but missed him. After some crawling, he finally found the portal room. He entered an address, and the portal slowly began programming the entered address. The portal buzzed and opened. Then the door opened, and the same man came in: tall, muscular, with white hair and red eyes. The man shot the soldier in the stomach, causing the soldier to fall backward into the portal. The only thing still visible was the soldier's shins. He quickly crawled backward, but his feet were still in the portal room. The man ran to the portal console and closed the portal. Two feet, severed at the ankles, lay on the ground. The rest of the man was gone.
