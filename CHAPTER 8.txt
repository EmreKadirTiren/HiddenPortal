Then the commander left the room, and we all looked at each other. Qiqi stood up and said, "Welcome. We will probably be working together for many hours, so it’s useful for us to get to know each other. I’ll start: my name is… let’s use codenames, just to be safe. My name is Q. Apparently, I’m your leader. I am a history teacher, and I happen to have a photographic memory. So, I know an awful lot about general history. As for the information about a weapon, I’ve never heard of it. But I have heard theories that have been discussed throughout history about the greatest pandemics."

He sat down, and the person to his right began to speak: "My name is M. I am a computer programmer, and after hacking illegally into one of the government systems, I erased my own offense. I’ll probably be helping with hacking buildings and, of course, with the help of the AI from the supercomputer, M.I.A., to find the KO." She sat down, and the boy next to her stood up, the same one who had given the presentation. "My name is J. I am a doctor and scientist. I’m here to study the virus, see how a machine makes it, and ensure the machine doesn’t perform its task." He sat down. Lastly, the military officer stood up: "My name is N. I’m in the military, and I’ll be helping coordinate other teams while we search for the KO." He sat down.

Then Qiqi began, "Let’s now take a look at what the organization already knows about the weapon and where we can find the next clue to locate the weapon."
