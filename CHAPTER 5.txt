The two men in black suits were wearing a special pin. It had some strange symbols on it, followed by the text "Agent: ØYñµ[ Agent." They asked Qiqi to follow them, and he did, stepping into the elevator with them. As he waited, he felt the elevator moving faster and faster. After a while, he started to wonder how deep they were going. After three minutes, he began to panic a little. A minute later, the agents noticed his unease and started putting on masks. When Qiqi saw this, it was already too late. Within a few seconds, everything started to get darker, and just before he passed out, one of the "agents" caught him.

When he woke up, he was in an interrogation room like the ones you see on detective shows or movies. Suddenly, the door opened, and a military officer appeared. He sat down in front of Qiqi. "Hello, Mr. Qiqi, we have been monitoring you for the past few days and haven't said much because there is a big problem. And you are the only one good enough, and whom we trust, to handle it. We've taken several precautionary measures, so I apologize for that. If you come with me, I’ll explain everything." Qiqi, who was confused, nodded and followed him.

The military officer led the way out of the room, and it seemed like they were in an underground bunker. To Qiqi, it felt like a maze; the walls were mostly made of concrete, but every now and then there was a large window to look through. As he walked, he passed by three laboratories. In the first one, they were building some kind of machine with food underneath it. In the next two, they were experimenting on animals. Eventually, they reached the end of a hallway where a door read "Meeting Room." They both entered the room, where there was a long table with about twenty people sitting around it, and there were two empty chairs left. Qiqi and the military officer sat down, and then a presentation began.
